            Logan is a guy who does code things at least 5 days a week, and
            has been doing so for a bit over a month now. He enjoys doing so, as well
            as video games, writing, and writing video games. His interest in
            video games about writing is yet to be established. He is
            shown here with his wife, with whom he frequently writes.
