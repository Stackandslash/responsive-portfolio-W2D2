            Logan is a guy who does code things at least 5 days a week, and
            will be doing so for the next few months. He enjoys this, as well
            as video games, writing, and writing video games. His interest in
            video games about writing is yet to be established. He would be
            shown here with his wife, but right now we have a kitten instead.
