# responsive-portfolio-W2D2
This is the Responsive Portfolio homework project due on Week 2, Day 2. It will have three web pages, labeled Index, Contact, and Portfolio.

This set of pages is designed to act as a small portfolio that displays suitably on a variety of screen sizes, and is tailored to suit smaller, mobile screens. It could be used for almost anything. What it will be used for, most likely, is kitten pictures.
